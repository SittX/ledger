# Service layer and data mutation structure

- **Server Action:** web data mutation and form submission goes to server action directly.
- **Route Handler:** exposes APIs to the external platform.
- **Service Classes:** shares business logic between the server actions and route handlers.
- **Server-side Validations:** validate submitted data in the _service classes_ using _zod_ for validation.
- **Client-side Validations:** uses react-hook-form to handle validation, submission feedback and loading status.
