# Learning Rules

- **Identify:** If you use a library, pattern, or logic I haven't used yet, flag it.
- **Explain:** Add a `## Key Concepts` section at the end.
- **Format:** Use a bulleted list. Max 2 sentences per concept.
- **Simple Terms:** Explain technical terms like "Middleware" or "State" simply if they appear for the first time.
